# Style Guide Extracts

These extracts demonstrate my approach to consistent, high-quality technical documentation. They cover tone, terminology, formatting, and real-world editing examples.

---

## Tone and Voice

- Use **active voice**: "Click the button" (not "The button should be clicked").
- Be concise, direct, and user-focused.
- Avoid unnecessary jargon and filler words.
- Maintain a professional yet approachable tone.

---

## Terminology

- Use "application" (not "app").
- Use "sign in" (not "login" as a verb).
- Prefer "select" over "choose" for UI actions.
- Consistent capitalization for product names (e.g., "Doc Scanner").

---

## Formatting Rules

- Use sentence case for headings.
- Always use fenced code blocks for code samples.
- Numbered steps for procedures; bullets for lists.
- Bold UI elements and menu paths (e.g., **File > Export**).
