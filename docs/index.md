## About me

I‚Äôm Tharun, a technical writer passionate about bridging engineering and communication.
I specialize in docs-as-code workflows, AI-assisted documentation, and automation pipelines that make technical content scalable, consistent, and developer-friendly.

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve built tools that analyze user manuals with NLP, automated review systems for documentation, and continuous delivery pipelines that publish docs directly from Git repositories.

My goal is simple ‚Äî to create documentation that‚Äôs as smart and reliable as the software it describes. My expertise blends:

- **Docs-as-Code**: MkDocs, CI/CD, automated publishing
- **DevOps for Documentation**: Custom pipelines, quality gates, and review automation
- **NLP & AI**: Style rule engines, readability metrics, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Modern Tooling**: Python, Flask, spaCy, GitHub Actions, Fluid Topics
